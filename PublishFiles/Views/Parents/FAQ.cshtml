                A. Once we are able to offer you a position, we invite you to take a Centre tour. When you have accepted the position, paid the $50 bond, you can then organise to begin transition visits with the Educators in the assigned room. The first visit is to get to know you and your child’s needs and individual requirements, the following visits (usual 3-4) are to trial leaving your child at different times of the day. This helps with beginning to form relationships and becoming familiar with the environment.
