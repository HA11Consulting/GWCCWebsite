                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <br />
                <p>	We strive to enrich the lives of the children, families and staff involved 	within the Centre.<br />

	We acknowledge that each child is a unique individual, belonging to a 	family within our culturally diverse community.<br />

	We acknowledge that each child and family brings its own language, 	customs and beliefs into our Centre, which enrich the life of the Centre.<br />

	We provide a warm, stimulating and challenging environment, which 	responds to individual learning styles, developmental needs, interests 	and 	personalities within a caring community.<br />

	We extend the nurturing practices of the family, including encouraging 	children to eat nutritionally balanced meals and snacks and we 	welcome 	close parent involvement with their child in the Centre.<br />

	We recognise the competencies of children and present opportunities	through play in which they can build confidence to approach new 	experiences and develop life skills.<br />
