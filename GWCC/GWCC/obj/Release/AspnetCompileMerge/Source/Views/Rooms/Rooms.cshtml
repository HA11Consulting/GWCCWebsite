                    <p>Our Nursery room offers education and care for children aged from 2 years to 3 years old. Nursery provides an extension from Babies with a very stimulating and engaging curriculum. The children engage in ‘hands-on’ experiences and explore their world around them. They have an extra play space which provides an outdoor undercover area especially great for those wet weather days for active toddlers.</p>
