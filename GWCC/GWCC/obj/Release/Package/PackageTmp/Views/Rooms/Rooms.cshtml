                    <p>Our Nursery room offers education and care for children aged from 2 years to 3 years old. Nursery provides an extension from Babies with a very stimulating and engaging curriculum. The children engage in ‘hands-on’ experiences and explore their world around them. They have an extra play space which provides an outdoor undercover area especially great for those wet weather days for active toddlers.</p>

                    <p>You will receive a very warm welcome when you step into our Baby Room. With a maximum of only 8 babies, the environment is a calm and nurturing space that provides high quality care and education to babies from 6 weeks up to 2 years of age. The two permanent Educators are very experienced with supporting both children and families to settle in and begin building secure relationships.</p>
