        <h2>Welcome to Grey Ward Children's Centre</h2>
        <p>Grey Ward Children's Centre is an Integrated Service, which caters for families with children from 6 weeks to 6 years of age. The Grey Ward Children's Centre was the second Kindergarten to be established in Adelaide. It began in 1908 and was developed in the image of Lillian de Lissa who began training teachers in 1907 in a cottage at Franklin Street.</p>

            About Grey Ward
        </h2>
        <p>
            Grey Ward Children's Centre retains its reputation for quality learning programmes, environment and philosophy.
            It prides itself as an inner city centre with a very large natural outdoor play space.
            The Management Committee, made up of parents and staff, currently has 18 employees and prides itself on its dedication to early childhood.
            The Management Committee actively works towards employing highly qualified staff and maintaining small group sizes, to enhance children's well-being and ability to form successful relationships.
            The Centre's curriculum is made up of the principles of inquiry based play, which is guided by The Early Years Learning Framework for Australia, Belonging, Being and Becoming as well as the philosophy of Professor Ferre Laevers and Dr Louise Porter.
            Today's Grey Ward community is made up of families working in the Adelaide CBD who are professional/semi professionals and the children of the Grey Ward community go to schools all over Adelaide.
            Some past students of Grey Ward have come back to the Centre and enrolled their own children.
            The staff and Management Committee are proud to be a part of the Centre and will continue to actively contribute to Early Childhood Education in South Australia for years to come.
